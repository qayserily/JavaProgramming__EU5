week 10 Review Topics: Static
			   		   Static vs Instance
			   		   Inheritance

instance: belong to the object. can be called through object
			each object has it's own copy of instance

			Constructor is used for setting instance variables

static: belong to the class. can be called through the class
		there is only one copy, shared by all objects

		static only accepts static

		members:
			static variable
			static methods (if method does not involve using isntance members)
			static block: executes only one time at the very beginning
			static inner class


instance vs static:
			muliple copes vs one copy
