Review Topics: Constructor Calls (Chaining rules)
			   OOP Encapsulation


task01:
            1. create an Array of string called country names
            2. write a program that can remove all the country names that have length of 10 or greater


task02:
            1. create an Array of String called jobTitles
            2. write a program that only keeps the jobTitles that are: SDET or QA


this: refers to the instance of object
		this. : to call instance variables and instance methods
		this(argument) : used for calling constructors

			constructor calls:
				1. Only a constructor can call another constructor
				2. Constructor cannot be called by its name, this() is needed
				3. Constructor calls needs to be at first step
				4. constructor cannot call itself, recursive is not aallowed
				5. One constructor can only call one constructor maximum


1. class Name: Employee
			instance variables:
					name, jobTitle, ID, salary

			1st constructor: initialize the name of the employee

			2d constructor: initialize the name, jobTitle of the employee
							(MUST apply constructor Call)

			3rd Constructor: initialize the name, jobTitle, ID of the employee
							(MUST apply constructor Call)

			4th Constructor: initialize all the instance of the employee
								(MUST apply constructor Call)

			Instance methods:
				toString()



OOP:Object Oriented Programming

		4 OOP concepts:
				1. Encapsulation
				2. Inheritance
				3. Abstraction
				4. Polymorphism



Encapsulation: Data Hiding
			1. hide the data by giving private access modifiers

						private: only visible within the class

			2. generate public getter/setters to read/modify the data

					getter (READ ONLY): public instance method
										return type needs to match with Private data
										0 parameter

					setter(Modify ONLY): public instance method
										 return type is void
										 1 parameter (data type matches with private data)
